A1,Raw material supply,Product,Capital,"Represents raw material extraction, precursor product processing, and final product
manufacture, its energy use, and waste management within these processes."
A2,Transport,Product,Capital,"All movement of materials and goods within the supply
chain up to the point of final factory gate"
A3,Manufacture,Product,Capital,"Final product used
in the infrastructure but also any pre-product elements it might demand. Packaging
and other material demands that may be necessary should also be included."
A4,Transport to works site,Construction process,Capital,"Represents transportation (including intermediate storage and distribution) of
products/materials and construction equipment (e.g. an asphalt paving machine or
a crane) to the infrastructure construction site from point of production (or point of
storage in the case of plant and machinery) to site works."
A5,Construction and installation processes,Construction process,Capital,Represents construction site works activities
B1,Use,Use,Capital,"Represents the carbon emitted directly from the fabric of
products and materials once they have been installed as part of infrastructure
and it is in normal use."
B2,Maintenance,Use,Capital / Operational,Represents the works activities and new materials for the maintenance of the infrastructure.
B3,Repair,Use,Capital / Operational,Represents the works activities and new materials for the repair of the infrastructure.
B4,Replacement,Use,Capital / Operational,Represents the works activities and new materials for the replacement of the infrastructure.
B5,Refurbishment,Use,Capital / Operational,Represents the works activities and new materials for the refurbishment of the infrastructure during.
B6,Operational Energy Use,Use,Operational,"Represents the carbon emissions resulting from the energy used by
infrastructure-integrated technical systems to enable it to deliver its service
during operation. This might be to provide heating and cooling, ventilation,
lighting, auxiliary energy for pumps, control and automation."
B7,Operational Water Use,Use,Operational,"This represents the carbon emissions resulting from the consumption of water
required by infrastructure to enable it to operate and deliver its service. It will
include all water used and its treatment (pre- and post-use) during the normal
operation of the infrastructure."
B8,Other operational processes,Use,Operational,"Represents other process carbon emissions arising from infrastructure to enable it
to operate and deliver its service including management of operational waste."
B9,Users utilisation of infrastructure,Use,User,"Represents the activities associated with userâ€™s utilisation of the infrastructure
during the use stage."
C1,Deconstruction,End of life,Capital,"This represents all carbon emissions due to transport to disposal and/or until
the end-of-waste state of waste materials arising."
C2,Transport,End of life,Capital,"This represents all carbon emissions due to transport to disposal and/or until
the end-of-waste state of waste materials arising."
C3,Waste Processing for recovery,End of life,Capital,"Represents the activities associated with treatment and processing for recovery,
reuse and recycling of waste materials arising from infrastructure."
C4,Disposal,End of life,Capital,"The boundary includes the carbon emissions resulting from final disposal of
demolition materials (neutralisation, incineration with or without utilisation
of energy, landfilling with or without utilisation of landfill gases, etc.)."
